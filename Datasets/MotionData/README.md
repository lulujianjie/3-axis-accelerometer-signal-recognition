Each folder consists motion data in csv format and some data visualization in time domain.

Two wristbands (left and right) were used to collect acceleration data in x, y and z directions. Their IDs are indicated in the file named ?wb_pos_info?.
The motion data was collected continuously following the sequence (1) Walking, (2) Sitting, (3) Standing, (4) Squatting (pick up a box on the floor), and (5) Lying down. These motions are labeled in the .csv files. The label ?Nan? refers to transition between the motions.
